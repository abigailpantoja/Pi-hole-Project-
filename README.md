# Pi-hole-Project

Pi-hole is essentially a DNS server 
This project runs the DNS service on the local network and uses the Raspberry pi as the server.
Pi-Hole takes care of the DNS resolution by proxying the DNS traffic to third-party DNS services and blocking requests that feature on its blacklist.

Part of the project looks at the DNS queries for specific sites and which sites grab the most data.
